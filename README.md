I'm making this because all Functors are not Endofunctors, and I believe
that means that we are leaving the majority of what CT has to offer
programmers right on the table.

I don't know if there will be inference problems, ergonomic oddities,
or whatever else might explain why the vast majority of "mainstream"
adoption of CT in programming stops at JUST ONE CATEGORY, but I think
I don't really care. This will be fun to explore, and if it turns
out to be usable in the way I think it could, it might just turn out
to be meaningfully valuable as well.

I'll document some stuff eventually, for now see the source.
